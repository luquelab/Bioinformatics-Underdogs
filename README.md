### Bioinformatics-Underdogsüê∂

[Underdogs](https://github.com/luquelab/Bioinformatics-Underdogs) is a Python package designed to interpret multiple nucelotide sequences and determine conserved regions, pairwise seqeuence distance, and phylogenetic realtionships. The input seuqences must be in [FASTA] format (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/fastaformat). The pipeline will provide visualiztions (see [Gallery page](https://github.com/luquelab/Bioinformatics-Underdogs/docs/gallery/index.md)) of seqeuence length and GC content, a consensus plot of concerved protein allignment region, a heatmap of pairwise sequence distance, and a phylogeneic tree. These protein sequences can be exported and compared in programs like AlphaFold and ChimeraX using other packages. 


This is an evovling repository that was started 04 APR 2025. It is a group project produced by undergraduate students as part of a Bioinformatic Tools class (BIL552) at the University of Miami. Group members include Sophia Soli, Ryan McMullen, Aliyah Raza, Blake Goldberg, and Zahra Faghihi.
