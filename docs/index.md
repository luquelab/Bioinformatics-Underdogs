# Bioinformatics-Underdogsüê∂

## Welcome! 

[Underdogs](https://github.com/luquelab/Bioinformatics-Underdogs) is a Python package designed to interpret multiple nucelotide sequences and determine conserved regions, pairwise sequence distance, and phylogenetic relationships. The input sequences must be in [FASTA](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/fastaformat) format. The pipeline will [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) online NCBI databases to generate species assignments for each sequence, stored in a dataframe. THe pipeline will also provide visualiztions (see [Gallery page](https://github.com/luquelab/Bioinformatics-Underdogs/docs/gallery/index.md)) of sequence length and GC content, a consensus plot of concerved protein allignment region, a heatmap of pairwise sequence distance, and a phylogeneic tree. These protein sequences can be exported and compared in programs like AlphaFold and ChimeraX using other packages.  

This is an evovling repository that was started 04 APR 2025. It is a group project produced by undergraduate students as part of a Bioinformatic Tools class (BIL552) at the University of Miami. Group members include Sophia Soli, Ryan McMullen, Aliyah Raza, Blake Goldberg, and Zahra Faghihi.

## Organization

This web interface is organized into five sections: 

[Home](https://github.com/luquelab/Bioinformatics-Underdogs) (you are here!)

[Tutorial](https://github.com/luquelab/Bioinformatics-Underdogs/blob/main/docs/tutorial) The tutorial section contains detailed insturctions on how to use the Underdogs pipeline and includes a step-by-step example.

[Documentation](https://github.com/luquelab/Bioinformatics-Underdogs/blob/main/docs/documentation) The documentation section contains information on the packages and tools used in the pipeline.

[Gallery](https://github.com/luquelab/Bioinformatics-Underdogs/blob/main/docs/gallery/index.md) Visual outputs of the pipeline including plots, figures, heatmaps, and trees.
